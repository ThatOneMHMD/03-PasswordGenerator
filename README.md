# Portfolio: Muhammad Atrach

## LIVE URL

https://thatonemhmd.github.io/02-MyProtfolio-MuhammadAtrach-/

## Note 

To access the base HTML file of the webpage, click on the index.html file above! The HTML files for the AboutMe, ContactME, and Projects pages are displayed just above it. Additionally, the CSS styling sheets and other resources such as images can be found in the assets file!

## Description

This is a page for the my (Muhammad Atrach) Portfolio. When the LIVE URL is clicked, the Home Page will appear displaying a word describing what I do and a few of my services. When the Contact link (at nav or footer) is clicked, the page will turn into my Contact Me page. The Projects link connects to my projects while the About link explains more about who I (Muhammad Atrach) am/is. Lastly, when the 'M" logo (short for Muhammad) to the left of the nav, or the copyright mark to the left side of the footer are clikced, they connect to the Home Page again! 

Note: in the screenshots underneath, noly the Home Page is displayed. Adding the others would make the README file pretty crowded and inefficient!
